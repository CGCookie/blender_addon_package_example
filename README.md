# Blender Add-on Packaging Example

This repository and (more importantly), its commit history illustrates the steps necessary to convert a Blender add-on from being a single-file Python script into a multi-file add-on in a basic folder structure.

The original add-on code was provided by Blender itself, shipped as a Python template. From Blender 3.4, that add-on is available by going to the Text Editor and navigating to Templates > Python > Addon Add Object.

A more detailed description of this process can be found on the [Orange Turbine blog](https://orangeturbine.com/posts/how-to-convert-your-one-file-blender-add-on-to-an-add-on-package).
